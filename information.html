                <p>Virtual reality enables a person to interact with a 3D or other sensory environment.VR applications immerse the user by using interactive devices that send and receive information and are worn as googles headsets, gloves, or bodysuits. Virtual Reality has many uses including gaming, healthcare,military and in business.

                <h3>VR Gaming</h3>
                <p>Virtual reality gaming is the combination of hardware and software to create a digital interactive environment.  Everypart of the hardware must work together to exchange data.Virtual reality gaming was developed to create a unique and rewarding gaming experience. Vr allows p;auers to do actions in the real world such as jumping and crouching.</p>
                <h3> Types of Vitural Reality Gaming Systems</h3>
                <p>Virtual Reality can be used on Advanced gaming laptops, game consoles, and even on smartphones, </p>
                <h3>VR in Business</h3>
                <p>There are many ways businesses incorporate VR. With virtual reality, a customer can “walk through” their designs and experience it before they buy a product. Virtual reality makes it possible for customers to interact with products that they would normally have to purchase first. Virtual reality also makes it possible to expand the gaming industry. Before VR the audience of games was limited by experience. Now with VR, games do not require experience with controllers. VR also makes it possible to experience a place without actually traveling there in person. It allows for things like skydiving, “traveling” across a country or even going to the beach.VR can also help with job training and provide hands-on learning. With VR a person can practice driving, learning about the human body and creating and testing new designs without breaking regulations.VR is useful in business in so many different ways.</p>
                <h3>VR in Military</h3>
                <p>The military interest in Virtual reality is growing everyday. Virtual reality has many benefits in the military such as the ability to create real scenarios , improved training times, improved recall and tension, scalability and adaptivity and ease of adoption.

               <p>Using VR in the military allows soldiers to practice exercises that would have usually been too expensive or dangerous to do in real life. Through Virtual reality, soldiers can develop combat skills and gain confidence in their abilities. According to HTC Vive, “80% of active duty military trainers who used VR for training reported an increase in their crew's confidence”.  Virtual reality makes it possible for soldiers to work through challenging situations that would be impossible to recreate without virtual reality. VR also reduces how long it takes soldiers to learn new skills and allows them to gain more experience.

                <p>Virtual Reality can provide many benefits in education. With virtual reality students can attend virtual field trips, lab environments, and even historical events. Virtual reality can be used to combat virtual distanced learning as well. With Virtual reality students that are online can interact and learn in a more effective and interactive way. According to a 2022 National research group report “67 percent of U.S highschool educators surveyed and said they would like to see extended reality technologies like Vr used regularly in schools”. Virtual reality can help different types of students and reach a broader range of learners 
</p>
          <h4> How does it work</h4>
           <p>A student would put on a VR headset with hardware which lets a user navigate within the constructed world. This allows for an immersive experience for a student. Some VR equipment can be accessed on a different device which is not as immersive, still a student is able to participate and learn in an interactive way.

               History of VR
           </h2>
           <h3>
              STEREOSCOPE: 1838 
 
           </h3>
           <p>
               In 1838 British scientist Charles Wheatstone constructed a stagnant device which used two flat images reflected through a set of mirrors in order to create the illusion of viewing a single 3D image. Though this contraption was simple and Wheatstone’s invention would effectively be replaced within twelve years of its conception, it was this device which would serve as the foundation that the next 185 years of virtual reality would be built upon. 


           </p>
           <h3>
            STEREOVISION: 1928   
           </h3>
           <p>
               In 1928, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird demonstrated an early system of three-dimensional television. This device is composed of two transmitting devices that are connected to a receiving device which contains a CRT tube which alternates between the two transmitting devices. This causes the images to be displayed side by side into a stereoscopic viewing device which uses two prisms to make the images converge and appear as one. And while important in the eventual development of VR, at the time, it was, as one report put it, “really unnecessary, and those who have the knack can make the images blend… This is, in fact, the method used by most experts in stereoscopy. They seldom use the stereoscope, but rely upon the naked eye; in much the same way as a user of the microscope keeps both eyes open”(R.F. Tiltman, Radio News, November 1928).

           </p>
           <h3>
               SENSORAMA: 1962

           </h3>
           <p>
               In 1962 Morton Heilig, an American cinematographer, sought to create, “(an) apparatus to stimulate the senses of an individual to simulate an actual experience realistically.”(Sensorama Simulator, Morton L. Heilig. [1962, August 28]. Ser. No. 81864). First and foremost this device was intended to assist in the training of workforces in which training in a real environment may pose serious risks to the individual. The device simulated these experiences by lightly stimulating an individual’s senses though wind, odor, binaural audio, as well as small vibrations and jolts. The device began to be pitched to companies like Ford and International Harvester in the mid 1950’s. However, the professional market which Heilig attempted to enter the device into wasn’t ready for it and it ultimately fell short of funding needed to get off the ground. And while the device would end up finding great success in its use as an arcade machine, that success came in the form of quarters, a drop in the bucket of debt Heilig had accumulated. Ultimately, like its predecessors, the device was more of a novelty and saw less and less use as time went on. Heilig gave up on the sensorama, letting the patent expire in 1979. He would not truly receive recognition in his time for his contributions to VR as a training device but especially for seeing its potential as a commercial product.

           <h3>
               VITAL HELMET: 1979

           </h3>
           <p>
               By 1979 McDonnell Douglas had begun development of the “VITAL” helmet-mounted display. This device used an electromagnetic head tracker in order to sense where the user was looking. Two cathode ray tubes mounted next to the user’s ears project computer generated images into beam splitters in front of the user’s eyes. This helmet was the first of its kind to be proven practical outside of tests.

           <h3>
               FURNESS SUPER COCKPIT: 1986
           </h3>
           <p>
              In 1986 American engineer and inventor, Tom Furness developed the “Furness Super Cockpit” while serving as an officer at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The “Super Cockpit” operated as a combination of systems which operated in conjunction with one another in order to both reduce the clutter of the control panel and integrate it into the pilot's vision.

           <h3>
               VPL RB2 SYSTEM: 1989

           </h3>
           <p>
               In 1989 VPL Research released the RB2 system, VPL was one of the first virtual reality companies to see major acceptance by both the commercial and professional market, being utilized by Nasa with the intention of integrating it into the operations of things like the ISS. However, this device had its limitations and was in too early a stage to actually be relied on to carry out important tasks. Although this did not stop the device from seeing a good amount of success in the commercial market. Ultimately, much like the sensorama, VPL had incurred many debts and in 1990 filed for bankruptcy. All of VPL’s  patents were eventually bought up by another company active in VR by 1999

           </p>
           <h3>
              VIRTUALITY: 1993
 
           </h3>
           <p>
               Virtuality, unlike VPL, was almost exclusively targeted at the commercial market at first. The first generation of Virtuality headsets came with a total of four games, the second with five games, and the third with six. The third device was the most powerful by far, powered by an intel 486-pc(later upgraded to an intel pentium) and rendered with a Motorola 88110 processor. In 1994 virtuality developed the Elysium, the first of its kind to be developed in partnership with IBM to be used architectural, medical, and construction applications
